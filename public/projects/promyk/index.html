        <h2 class="section-title">About</h2>
        <p class="project-description">Akademia Promyk is Polish kindergarten. I created a website which main focus was design matching the theme of the website and good advertisment and showing good sides of the object.
            To maximalize advertising potential I had to focus on good SEO (I aimed for 100/100 in Google Lighthouse audit).
            Important requirement of this website is possibility to edit content by non-technical person with simple use of CMS.
            One of the most important upsides of this kindergarten is colorful garden and the second one are really interesting activities - to show this impressive aspects interactive gallery is nessecary.
        </p>

        <p class="project-description">
            I decided to use GatsbyJS because of its impressive SEO potential and good optimization of images. 
            To manage content of the website I used DatoCMS combining with GitHub Actions to trigger build website on the server.
        </p>
        <h2 class="section-title">DatoCMS</h2>
        <p class="project-description">
            Website is gonna be administrated by non-technical person so I decided to use DatoCMS to manage content of the webiste.
            There was to reasons I decided to go with this solution:
            <ul class="project-ul">
                <li>It's free</li>
                <li>It's often used with GatsbyJS, so there is plenty of documentation</li>
            </ul>
        </p>
        <p class="project-description">
            <br>

            So the base integration with netlify hosting was quite easy to configure.
            <br>
            I have started to have some problems while trying to configure automatic deploy on my shared web server hosting (<a target="_blank" href="https://mydevil.net">mydevil.net</a>).
            The only possible solution that came up to my mind was using Github Actions - which I have never used before.

        <h2 class="section-title">Lighthouse results</h2>
        <img class="project-image" src="./lighthouse.png" alt="Image of lighthouse results 91/100 performance 85/100 accessability 100/100 best practices 100/100 SEO">
        <p class="project-description">
            <br>
            The image shows that the goal result of 100/100 SEO points 
            in Google Lighthouse audit could be easly achived by using GatsbyJS.
            Another conclusions from Lighthouse audit are that there is still room to improve performance and accessability.

        <h2 class="section-title">What's next?</h2>
        <p class="project-description">
            Project is pretty much finished and waiting to be deployed on realease date.
            <br>
            The website is hosted on netlify at this moment and not used in production.
