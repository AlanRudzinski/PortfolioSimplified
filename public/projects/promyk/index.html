        <p class="project-description">Akademia Promyk is Polish kindergarten. I created a website which main focus was design matching the theme of the website and good advertisment and showing good sides of the object.
            To maximalize advertising potential I had to focus on good SEO (I aimed for 100/100 in Google Lighthouse audit).
            Important requirement of this website is possibility to edit content by non-technical person with simple use of CMS.
            One of the most important upsides of this kindergarten is colorful garden and the second one are really interesting activities - to show this impressive aspects interactive gallery is nessecary.

        <p class="project-description">
            I decided to use GatsbyJS because of its impressive SEO potential and good optimization of images. 
            To manage content of the website I used DatoCMS combining with GitHub Actions to trigger build website on the server.
